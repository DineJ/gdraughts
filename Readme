Gdraughts - Dine JRIDI


Description:

Gdraughts is a checkers game program written in python3/GTK3. It is licensed under the GPL (see the file named License)

It is aimed mainly at Linux users but should work on other systems too.

This project aims is to be able to play with all the rules. The main problem is that nobody has a version for each way to play this game. I created a checkers game to anwser at that.



Usage:

When you started the game, you have 3 options :
    - option 1, play
    - option 2, open the first dialog box and select a difficulty and a country
    - option 3, opent the second dialog box, select with which rules you want to play and with what difficulty
    
In the first dialog box, you have a limited choice of country (currently France, Spain, England, Netherlands, Italy). 
Of course, someone may not want to play with these rules for any reason. That's why the second dialog box is here. She allow to create your own game.

On the right of the application, you can see messages appear each time a movement is made. It is the Manoury rating that allows you to redo a game with this list of moves.
Black moves are always marked in parentheses, the message is made up of 3 parts:
    -part 1, the starting square
    -part 2, the information of the move
    -part 3, the finishing square

For part 1 and part 3, the notation is as follows. Note the boxes 1 by 1 starting with the black side and only on the active boxes. Here is a link with photos to explain in more detail.

For part 2, there are 2 things. An "-" which signifies a movement or an "x" which signifies that someone has just eaten.

When someone wins, at the end of the message appears a "+", which means the move that wins the game
