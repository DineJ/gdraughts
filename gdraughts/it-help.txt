This part is used for players who know the Manoury notation which allows you to redo and analyze the games later. On the right of the checker game, you can see messages appear each time a movement is make. It is the Manoury rating that allows you to redo a game with this list of moves. Black moves are always marked in parentheses, the message is made up of 3 parts:
	- part 1, the starting square
	- part 2, the information of the move
	- part 3, the finishing square
For part 1 and part 3, the notation is as follows. Note the squares 1 by 1 starting with the black side and only on the active squares. Here is a link with photos to explain in more detail.
